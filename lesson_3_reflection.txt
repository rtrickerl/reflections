When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    When you have a team working on a project, or when you want to keep a project synced
    between multiple devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    If the repository is changed on GitHub, an automatic pull could break 
    any local changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are used to create a new repository from an existing one. Changes cannot be 
    merged back into the repository they were forked from. (This is a GitHub only feature).
    Clones are used to clone a repository.
    Branches are a copy of a repository. Changes can be merged back into the branch
    they were created from.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It keeps other developers changes from cluttering your cloned repository.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

    The collaboration would require email, phone, or 1-on-1. These other forms are
    many times less efficient.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
